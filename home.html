The history of Tawi-tawi can be traced back to ancient times when it was part of the Sultanate of Sulu.

In the early 20th century, Tawi-tawi became part of the American-controlled Philippines. The island played a significant role during World War II as a base for Japanese forces. After the war, Tawi-tawi was incorporated into the newly independent Republic of the Philippines.
